## Basics of incident management

1. What has happened?

2. What is the plan? 

3. Who is in charge? 

## Top priorities when arriving at an incident 

1. Understand organisational priorities

2. Ensure immediate priorities are being actioned

3. Gain situational awareness

4. Assess risks and issues

5. Integrate with the business-wide strategic response

6. Define ways of working and build response tempo

7. Establish measurable incident objectives

8. Select appropriate strategies to achieve objectives

9. Perform tactical direction 

10. Provide necessary follow-up

## Key questions to ask

1. What has happened? 

2. How have you responded? 

3. Have you considered the legal and regulatory implications? 

4. Have senior leadership been briefed? 

5. Who have you notified? 

6. What are you concerned about? (risks / issues)

7. What are your priorities? 

8. What is your plan? 

9. Who is in charge? 

10. What is your plan if the incident escalates? (and how will you identify this?)

## Red line or watch out criteria 

1. Attacker finds a previously unidentified route into the environment

2. Attacker moves towards sensitive or personal data

3. Attacker compresses or stages files

4. Attacker accesses internet facing servers

5. Attacker gains domain administrator privileges 

6. Attacker gains access to a domain controller

7. Attacker adds or edits users in Active Directory

8. Attacker carries out activity indicating potential destructive intentions

## Key investigative questions 

1. When was the window of compromise?

2. How did the attacker initially gain access to the environment?

3. What systems did the attacker access and/or compromise?

4. How did the attacker access and/or compromise these systems?

5. What accounts did the attacker compromise?

6. What activity was carried out by the attacker within the environment?

7. What data did the attacker access and how did the attacker do this?

8. What evidence is there of data ex-filtration?

9. Does the attacker still have access to the environment?

10. Has the attack concluded?

## Delivering the technical response to an incident 

| Investigation / Intelligence | Operations                   | Planning               | Logistics / PMO   |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Investigation                | Evidence Collection          | Investigation Planning | Action Tracking   |
| Threat Intelligence          | Tech Deployment (Visibility) | Situational Awareness  | Resourcing        |
| Impact Assessment            | Monitoring and Hunting       | Remediation Planning   | Finance and Admin |
|                              | Remediation and Recovery     |                        |                   |

## Key issues 

1. No clear or suitable incident management structures 

2. Lack of "operational rhythm" and programme management 

3. No clear strategy and objectives driving response efforts

4. Poor communication and collaboration

5. Lack of leadership and accountability 

6. No clear understanding of the facts which matter 

## Key documents

1. Incident Action Plan

2. Ways of Working

3. Red Line / Watch Out Criteria 

4. Immediate Priorities Checklist 

5. Incident Timeline

6. Remediation Plan

7. Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions Tracker

8. Status Updates 

## Key areas of the environment 

* Workstations
* Email and Web 
* Servers
* Cloud
* Networks / Data centers
* Applications
* Identity
* Data

## Key logs

* Server and workstation operating system logs
* Authentication logs (e.g. login, remote access, VPN)
* Application logs (e.g. web logs, database logs)
* Network logs (e.g. web proxy logs, firewall logs, NetFlow)
* Security Tool logs (e.g. EDR, anti-virus, mail filtering logs)

## Immediate Priority Checklist 

1. Senior management are being briefed on the incident, risks and issues

2. Action is being taken to mitigate any unacceptable risks to the business 

3. Evidence is being collected and preserved

4. Legal & regulatory obligations are being assessed

4. Gaps in technical visibility have been identified and are being resolved 

5. Incident response and crisis management plans have been initiated

## Considering response strategy

* Priorities and objectives
* Risks and issues 
* Understanding of the environment
* Visibility of the environment 
* Organisational and technical capability / capacity to respond 
* Investigative findings so far, including knowledge of the adversary
